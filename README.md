# AdventureGame

## Description
This is a text based adventure game. The goal of this game is to defeat all the bosses and villains in the story. You will get help from the other characters in the game and build relationships with them. Some of the characters may fall in love with you along the way. Enjoy the game and have fun! 
This is a work in progress and a guide will be added soon.

A .exe file will be added soon for those who do not have python installed on their computer.

## Installation
To play this game, you will need to have python installed on your computer. You can download python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
To find the game runner, go to the folder titled "AdventureGameFiles" and run the file "main.py" in the terminal.

Once the .exe file is added, you will be able to play the game without having python installed on your computer.
